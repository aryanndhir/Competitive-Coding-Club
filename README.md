# Competitive-Coding-Club
The Competitive Coding Club is a group of students that recruits and trains
students to represent MPSTME at various coding contests.<br /> We strive to provide
opportunities for students to supplement their learnings with out-of-classroom
experiences through regular meetings, discussions, competitions and workshops.
<br />Having a Discord server and WhatsApp group, we felt it was time to move one
step ahead and build a website. We thought of this for two primary reasons: to be
discoverable in search engine results and to build credibility.
As far as the features of our website are concerned, we have implemented the
following: home page, leaderboard, contests (coding calendar) and registration.
